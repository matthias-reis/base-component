# CurrentTask: Implement Task

- **ID**: `#6`
- **Title**: `Fix Build`
- **Workpackage Name**: `issues/6-fix-build`

## Task Description

- A detailed plan has already been worked out in a previous step. Your task is to implement everything specified in `issues/6-fix-build/PLAN.md`.
- Modify only code/docs/tests required by the plan.
- Create or update `issues/6-fix-build/qa.md` with a consistent but minimal QA checklist / test plan. 
  - Omit steps that are tested automatically (like linters)
  - Try to create a recipe-like order starting with running the app locally, navigationg to a url, etc.
- After the implementation, append a line to `issues/6-fix-build/cost.md` with:
  - timestamp (UTC), provider, model, input_tokens, output_tokens, total_tokens, estUSD, headers snapshot (remaining/reset if available).
- Do **not** change `PLAN.md`.
- create a local commit if possible. If not propose a commit statement including message.
